We use kth order Markov Chain to solve sequence prediction problem in bioinformatics

+ `genomes` contains ten reference genomes
+ `test.fa` contains several labeled sequence which can be used for model training or validation. The annotation file is `seq_id.map`
+ `reads.fa` is the unlabeled short sequences used for prediction
